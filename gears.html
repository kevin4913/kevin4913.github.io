            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
             The goal of this project was to explore a material of our choice by highlighting
             material properties that are unique to our chosen material.
             I chose to work with silicone and chose to highlight a few important charecteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Silicone, becuase of its low stress to strain relationship, it
             allows for the creation of molds that are much simpler than would be possible with
             a more rigid material.Secondly, and the material property that I was most exicited for was its ability to be food safe once cured.
             in order to highlight these two propreties, I wanted to create molds that allowed me to cast planitary gearboxes out of chocolate.
            </p>

            <h3>Initial Testing</h3>

                <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/silicone-vacuum.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/silicone-piston-mold.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/silicone-ice-piston.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/silicone-ice-gear.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              Going into the project, becuase I had limited expirence in silicone molding, I wanted to validate the process that I was planning
              to use for the project. The first thing that I wanted to look at was how well I could create n object that would normally need
              a multipart mold to cast. I decided for this test that casting a small piston that has a small 'CMU' inscribed on the side as well
              as a couple rings on the bottom. I also chose to use ice to test my molds as it has a fast set time, is readily available, and has
              similar properties to chocolate, especially in the retlation to its brittleness.
            </p>

            <p>
              The results of the initial testing was suprisingly good. It is difficult to see above because of the clear ice, but the details on the
                cylinder of the piston was extremely good - these details are much easier to see in the ice gears that I also tried.
                The issue with the piston, and the main reason I decided to transition to the planitary gears was that the stem of the piston
                would generally snap when trying to get the piston out of the mold. Even cutting the mold into parts failed to eleviate this issue.
            </p>


            <h3>Second Iteration</h3>
            <p>Manufacturing was a major aspect to this project for a variety of reasons.
              Not only did we have to utalize advanced machining, such as the CNC mill,
              to produce the required geometries for the arms, but for our second version, we
              had to mill carbon fiber sheets which called for specific manufacturing processes.
              This allowed us to create geometries that were more condusive to the bending and
              loads that we expected durring the testing procedure.
            </p>

                 <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/gripper-cnc.gif" alt="" /></span></div>

               </div>
             </div>
           <p>
             Our idea to produce the lightest gripper in the class was centered
             around the usage of carbon fiber sandwich board for the main body of the
             gripper. The use of this material posed specific challenges regarding to the
             manufacturing of said parts. Since the material we were using was carbon fiber,
             we had to search out specialized machines on campus that could handle the
             handle the material without causing health risks. Once we were able to secure
             time on a machine, we were able to mill out each of our components using
             high frequency and rpm was used along with a downward spiral, two flute end mill for optimal results.
             Finally, once the parts were cleaned up a bit with a drill press, we applied
             two part epoxy along the edges of the parts which dramatically increased the
             rigidity of the foam core carbon fiber in off axis loading.
