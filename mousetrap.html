              <h3> Project Description </h3>
              <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a mousetrap car that could
                travel 18 feet forward and then reverse back to the start. The car
                that traveled the distance in the least amount of time would be the
                winner of the competition. There would be two design reviews, with the
                last one determining your overall performance score.
              </p>
              <u1>There were a few major guidelines for this project:
                <li> All of the potential energy must originate in the mouestrap </li>
                <li> The mousetrap car must start within a certain area and must
                  be within a certain size </li>
                <li> The mosetrap car must fully pass the 18 foot mark before reversing
                  for the trial to be legal </li>
                <li> The timer will stop when the first part of the vehicle crosses
                  the finish line </li>
              </u1>
              <p></p>

              <h3> Design Highlights </h3>
              <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mousetrap-axle.png" alt="" /></span>
                The most important aspect of our design was the custom axle.
                One of the challenges with this project was creating a vehicle that
                could both cover at least 36 feet of distance, but also be able to do it
                quickly. With this as a goal, we designed a variable width axle. This axle
                was comprised of a 1/4 inch dowel fitted with 3D printed steps.</p>
              <p>This axle was designed to allow for fast acceleration, yet have high speed
                as well as allow for distance. This was achieved by starting the string
                on the largest diameter step, then after one rotaion would step down
                to the next, so on and so on until it was on the smallest step. This
                allowed our vehicle to accelerate at a faster rate than comparably
                sized mousetrap cars. This step down process occurred two times each
                trial, once at the start, and again when the vehicle changed direction
                and started heading back to the start.
              </p>
              <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mousetrap-wheelcover.png" alt="" /></span>
                Another important design feature were the drive wheels themselves.
                Not only did we want them to be aesthetically pleasing, but we also
                wanted to limit the inertia in the wheels. By limiting this inertia, we
                would be able to convert more of our moustrap energy into linear
                velocity. With these criteria in mind, we designed the drive wheels
                to have most of the material within the wheel cut out using laser
                cutters. What material we did keep, most of it is concentrated
                towards the center, such that most of the mass is close to the
                center of the wheel.
              </p>
              <p>Another decision was in relation to the front
                wheels, or lack there of. With the front wheels not driving, the
                diameter was not a constraint. With this, we decided that we could
                use the bearings themselves as our front wheels. This would allow
                for a very low friction wheel that had a very small amount ofinetia.
              </p>
              <p> Finally, the vehicle was designed such that everything but the
                variable axle was able to be laser cutted. This allowed us to have
                a lightweight that was easily repeatable. This manufacturing process
                allowed for our axles to be parralel which limied the twurning
                that we would expirence in our testing.
              </p>
              <h3> Final Version </h3>
              <p> We decided to switch to a double drive wheel system as the wheel
                base was not wide eonugh and the vehicle was very unstable. We also
                decided to make the smallest part of the drive axle 1/8 inches in
                diameter.
              </p>
              <p> With these changes, we were able to improve on our original time of
                11.8 seconds by over 2 seconds. Our best time was 9.3 seconds which
                was in the top 5 of groups.
              </p>
