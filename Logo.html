              <h3> The Concept </h3>
              <p> The idea was to create, from the ground up, a personal logo for myself.
                My goal for this project was to create something that could become
                a unique and recognizable simble which could be used on a website,
                or a resume, or simply a sticker for my laptop. There were a couple guidelines
                that I set for myself in order to create what I believed would be a successful
                logo.
              <u1>
                <li> It had to be unique. I did not want it being easily
                  confused with a different logo.</li>
                <li> The design had to prominently feature my initials. The most important
                  features of the design had to be a 'K' for Kevin and an
                  'O' for O'Neill.</li>
                <li> The logo must be simple enough such that a child could replicate it.
                  Often, I find that the best logos are simple, yet powerful. Think about
                  Target's logo and how recognizable yet simple it is.</li>
                <li> Finally, it must be colorful. This is basically personal preference
                  here, but I believe that the use of color really brings attention to
                  a logo.</li>
              </u1>
              </p>

              <h3> Initial Sketches </h3>
              <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/logocreation1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                To the right is a selcection of the sketches that I made for my logo.
                The main aspect that I expiremented with was how to deal with the 'O'.
                Whether it was a feature that surrounded the rest of the logo, or whether
                it was in the same 'plane' as the 'K', this design decision was a major factor
                in the end product. I ended up deciding to go with a bounding 'O' as I felt
                that it would give the design a sense of completeness while still staying true
                to the ideas that I set for myself at the beginning.
              <p> Another important decision that I worked on after deciding to go with an
                all encompasing 'O' was whether there should be aspects to the design that
                would go outside of the bounding shape. This came about as I felt
                that simply placing a 'K' in the circle would leave the design feeling disjointed
                and incomplete. In the end, I decided to go with a negative
                shape to break up both the 'K' as well as the 'O'
              </p>
