              <h3> Peg Board </h3>
              <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/peg-board.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                The lab was working with a team at Georgia Tech so that we could
                better mimick a real snake with our robotic version. To do this, we needed
                to manufacture a scale version of the testing course that they had
                their snake running through. The board was made out of wood and had an acrylic sheet placed on top
                as we wanted the snake robot to have to push off of the pegs in order to get through
                the course rather than using a grippy ground surface.
              </p>
              <p> After creating the peg board, I spend a couple of weeks with another
                member of the lab to do data collection. We would have the snake go through
                the course and film it from above while timing it. We would repeat this multiple
                times to get a sufficent sample size, then we would change the peg spacing and repeat.
                This allowed us to not only get side by side comparison to the real snake, but allowed
                us to have a controlled environment so that we could get objective results.
              </p>
              <h3> Silicone Ring </h3>
              <p>The other project I worked on during my summer in the lab was a
                protective silicone ring. There was a project to place souch senitive
                sensors onto the snake as a module. What we needed to do was come up
                with a method to protect the senors while still allowing them to
                be accessed for modification as well as maintain their ability to sense
                the environment around them.
              </p>
              <p> What I designed was a ring that had 12 'bumps'. The bumps were able
                to individually colapse such that when it came into contact with a surface
                it would colapse and contact the touch sensor. In order to make the
                ring flexible, I 3D printed the ring and then used it to create a negative mold
                which I then was able to use to make silicone rings. The ring was a success,
                unfortunatley the lab stopped exploring the sensor module shortly after I left.
