            <span class="image main"><img src="images/gripper-top.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/motor-housing.png" alt="" /></span>
             The objective of this project is to design and build a mechanism that
             would actuate in order to grip a supplied object when attached to a driven axle.
             The gripper would be mounted to a mounting plate that is at the base
             of the supplied motor assembly (pictured right). The gripper and object would then be swung
             from a 90 degree angle. After swinging, the object's location relative to its start
             would be measured, and if the object had displaced more than 0.1 inches
             in any direction, the gripper would not qualify. The performance of the gripper,
             past its ability to maintian control the object, would be determined by its weight.
            </p>
            <p>The design had a couple major constraints that our gripper had to
              follow.
              <u1>
                <li> The gripper would need to be swung into position without
                  disturbing the object </li>
                <li> The Gripper, when fully closed on the object, would need to
                  be within a 7"x7"x7" bounding box, proppegated from the base of
                  the motor assembly </li>
                <li> The gripper would not qualify if, by running the motor for
                  a continuous amount of time, re-closed or re-opened on the object </li>
            </p>

            <h3>The Design Process</h3>

            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gripper-analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              The first decison that we made was that we would have one starionary arm, and one dynamic arm.
              This would allow for a much simpler design than one that had more than one moving arm. This design would
              also be significantly lighter than one that used more than two arms as we determined that we would be able to get
              sufficient stability simply from 2 arms.

              <p>One of the first major design decisons that we had to make, outside of the shape of
              the gripper and how many points of contact we would have, was the mechanim to both
              open and close the gripper. We decided to use a string mechanism for a couple important reasons.
              First, by not using gears and similar mechanisms, we limited the number of axles that we needed
              in our design. Axles and gears, we determined, were disproportionately heavy for the benefits that they
              offered over something like a string. Additionally, by using a string, we were able to actuate the arm
              closer to the object. This allowed more of the force in the string to be translated to the object vs. a gear
              that actuated the arm near its rotational axle.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p> As a group, we decided that we would produce a heavy, yet safe design for the first design review such that we
              could produce an extremely light gripper for the second round. We did this for a couple reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>Because a significant portion of the grade was
                determined based on the performance of the gripper, we wanted to make sure that we had one that worked
                the first time. This would then allow us to push the limits with our second version as we would have
                a fall back gripper.
                </li>
                <li>With the carbon fiber sandwich being expensive and extremely tiresome to machine, we would be able
                  to identify risks and points of failure in our design before switching to the carbon fiber sandwich.
                </li>
                <li>As a group, we had limited to no expirence with the carbon fiber sandwich which we were planning
                  to use and therefore we had some fears that the carbon fiber sheets may not work the way we were expecting.
                </li>
                <li>There was an element of secrecy involved as we did not want other groups to be able to replicate our
                  final gripper design. had we used the sandwich board in the first round, there could have been groups
                  which procured their own sheets and it would make it much more difficult for us to be the lightest.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/gripper-render.png" alt="" /></span>


            <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>Manufacturing was a major aspect to this project for a variety of reasons.
              Not only did we have to utalize advanced machining, such as the CNC mill,
              to produce the required geometries for the arms, but for our second version, we
              had to mill carbon fiber sheets which called for specific manufacturing processes.
              This allowed us to create geometries that were more condusive to the bending and
              loads that we expected durring the testing procedure.

             </div>
           <p>
             Our idea to produce the lightest gripper in the class was centered
             around the usage of carbon fiber sandwich board for the main body of the
             gripper. The use of this material posed specific challenges regarding to the
             manufacturing of said parts.
             We had to search out specialized machines on campus that could
             handle the material without causing health risks. Once we were able to secure
             time on a machine, we were able to mill out each of our components using
             high frequency and rpm along with a downward spiral, two flute end mill for optimal results.
             Finally, once the parts were cleaned up a bit with a drill press, we applied
             two part epoxy along the edges of the parts which dramatically increased the
             rigidity of the foam core carbon fiber in off axis loading.
           </p>

           <h3>Design Review I</h3>
           <p>For the first design review, we produced a gripper that was mostly made of delrin,
             with some 3D printed parts, and some metal and plastic hardware. The spool that we 3D printed
             allowed us to interface with the motor and it allowed for two seperate strings: one which was the driving string,
             and a second which asted as a hardstop. Because of the increased radius due to the spool, we needed to loop our string
             through the arms such that they acted as pullies in order to get a satisfactory grip strength. The Dynamic arm was
             held up using a spring.
           </p>
           <p> This design weighed a total of 134 grams, which was about 60 grams heavier than the lightest gripper
             from the first round.
           </p>
           <div class="box alt">
             <div class="row gtr-uniform">
               <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/gripper-v1-left.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
               <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Round1Testing.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
             </div>
           </div>
           <p> For all the successes that this version represented, there were fundamental flaws in the design that would need
             to be addressed in order to have the lightest gripper.
             <ol>
               <li>Ditch the Delrin. The weight of the delrin used in the gripper was 87 grams by itself. Replacing it with the carbon
                 sandwich would save at least 80% of that weight.
               </li>
               <li>The spool, while functional was heavy at 16 grams and sometimes had a tendancy to get the seperate strings caught.
               </li>
               <li>The hardware that we used was also very heavy as a group. If we were to get down below 30 grams, we would need to
                 replace the metal harware with their nylon counterparts, or simply reduce the amount of hardware that we used.
               </li>
               <li>The path that the string took was causing a fairly large off axis moment to occur in the arm. While this was not a
                 huge issue for the delrin, once we switched to the carbon fiber sandwich, it could easily cause catistrophic failure.
               </li>
             </ol>
           </p>

           <h3> Final Design </h3>
           <p>
             With these challenges in mind we began the process to alter our gripper and
             when the carbon fiber was being milled, our attention turned to the spool and the
             string path. For the spool, we came up with a very elegant solution in which the
             spool acts like a one way ratchet. In addition, we designed a spacer such that the
             string could travel through the mounting base and down to the arm. This would eleviate
             the off axis bending found in the static arm.
           </p>
           <p> These adjustments, along with the increased use of adhesives, switching out the delrin,
             and minimizing the metal used in the gripper allowed us to pruduce a working gripper
             that only weighed 23.4 grams.
           </p>

           <p> This weight was a significant achievement, not only for the improvement that we showed from our
             first version, but the class average was 150 grams and the next closest gripper was 40 grams.
           </p>
