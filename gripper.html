            <span class="image main"><img src="images/gripper-top.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/motor-housing.png" alt="" /></span>
             The objective of this project is to design and build a mechanism that
             would actuate in order to grip a supplied object when attached to a driven axle.
             The gripper would be mounted to a mounting plate that is at the base
             of the supplied motor assembly (pictured right). The gripper and object would then be swung
             from a 90 degree angle. After swinging, the object's location relative to its start
             would be measured, and if the object had displaced more than 0.1 inches
             in any direction, the gripper would not qualify. The performance of the gripper,
             past its ability to maintian control the object, would be determined by its weight.
            </p>
            <p>The design had a couple major constraints that our gripper had to
              follow.
              <u1>
                <li> The gripper would need to be swung into position without
                  disturbing the object </li>
                <li> The Gripper, when fully closed on the object, would need to
                  be within a 7"x7"x7" bounding box, proppegated from the base of
                  the motor assembly </li>
                <li> The gripper would not qualify if, by running the motor for
                  a continuous amount of time, re-closed or re-opened on the object </li>
            </p>

            <h3>The Design Process</h3>

            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/crane-sketch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              Going into the first design review, we assumed that the arm itself was massless.
              This is neither practical nor possible, but we chose to runw ith it because the
              center of mass of the arm was so close to the axis of rotation-- thus the moment
              caused by the arm itself was negligible compared to the torque of the servo, the
              weight of the counterweight, and the force due to the weight.
              <p>Additionally, we assumed that the arm would lift a max of 60 degrees.
              Although the servo was capable of rotating further, as the arm increased
              in angle, the change in x position due to trigonometric properties would cause
              the arm to no longer be ablle to lift the weight. As a result, a 60% lift angle
              would be a safe bet for the actual max lift angle. Lastly, we assumed that the max
              torque by the servo was 57 oz-in. After some prototyping, we discovered that we weren't
              getting anywhere near that torque despite that was what the manufacturer rated the servo for.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p> Once we were happy with our conceptual design, we used Solidworks to model
              the crane in an assembly. This allowed us to perform some basic
              simulations to determine the deflection at the end of the crane as well
              as its structural validity. These calculations helped determine what the
              inner and outer diameter of our structural members needed to be.
            </p>

            <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>Manufacturing was a major aspect to this project for a variety of reasons.
              Not only did we have to utalize advanced machining, such as the CNC mill,
              to produce the required geometries for the arms, but for our second version, we
              had to mill carbon fiber sheets which called for specific manufacturing processes.
              This allowed us to create geometries that were more condusive to the bending and
              loads that we were expecting in durring the testing procedure.

           <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/carbon-cnc.png" alt="" /></span>
             Our idea to produce the lightest gripper in the class was centered
             around the usage of carbon fiber sandwich board for the main body of the
             gripper. The use of this material posed specific challenges regarding to the
             manufacturing of said parts. Since the material we were using was carbon fiber,
             we had to search out specialized machines on campus that could handle the
             handle the material without causing health risks. Once we were able to secure
             time on a machine, we were able to mill out each of our components using
             high frequency and rpm was used along with a downward spiral, two flute end mill for optimal results.
             Finally, once the parts were cleaned up a bit with a drill press, we applied
             two part epoxy along the edges of the parts which dramatically increased the
             rigidity of the foam core carbon fiber in off axis loading.
           </p>

           <h3>Design Review I</h3>
           <p>We were getting essentially 2 inches of height up until the night
             before the first design review. The main source of error that we
             encountered was the fact that the servo we were using was not consistent.
             Not only did we see different capabilities between different controllers,
             but also when we began the design review, we realized that the servo was
             performing at a reduced level compared to the night before. Our suspicions
             were confirmed when we switched servos and our crane performed better.
           </p>
           <span class="image main"><img src="images/cranereview1.gif" alt="" /></span>
           <p>The actual output of our crane was much worse than the calculations
             that we did to find our theoretical servo torque as well as our
             theoretical lift height. Initially we calculated that using a
             counterweight that had its center of mass six inches from the axis
             of rotation would provide plenty of torque to allow for the servo
             to easily lift the weight. Unfortunately, when we placed our design
             on the field, we quickly found that the arm could barely lift the
             weight and that the crane was nowhere near the 2 inches that we
             needed to achieve.
           </p>

           <h3> Final Design </h3>
           <p>
             Coming out of the first review, we added a 45 degree bend in the
             lever arm and improved our counterweight so it would no longer hit our crane arm.
             Additionally, we milled a smaller base that allowed for more adjustability
             when it came to iterating for our final version.
           </p>
           <p> Our final crane was extremely adjustable in terms of rotation as
             well as adjusting our servo mount to get the arm to interact with the
             weight at the correct angle. Hollowed rods allowed for us to minimize
             weight without sacrificing structural integrity, especially in respect
             to bending.The tension strips that were instrumental in
             preventing further bending as it prevented bending for the first 60%
             of the crane arm length. The angled arm allowed for the weight to be
             lifted at a larger distance from the servo while still allowing the
             servo to cotrol the arm at the beginning.
           </p>

           <p> As a group we were able to design and manufacture a crane that lifted
             the weight 4.875 inches which was second in the class.
