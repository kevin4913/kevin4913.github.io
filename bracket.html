              <h3>Project Description</h3>
              <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bracket-description.jpg" alt="hello world" /></span>
               Using laser-cut acrylic, we were tasked to hold 25 pounds of
               weight for at least 10 seconds. The lightest bracket out of all
               would be declared the winner. The bracket not only had to mount
               with standardized hardware, but there were also limitations on
               where the bracket could be mounted as well as an exclusion zone
               that your bracket was not allowed to enter. The bracket would
               also be rejected if it deplaced the weight by more than 1/4 inch
               in any direction.
              </p>
              <p>The image on the left is a drawing of the testing apparatus.
                The region that is boxed off on both sides is the region in
                which you cannot mount your bracket. The rectangular area
                in the middle is the forbidden region in which the bracket cannot
                enter. Lastly, the weight must be held 0.4 inches from the
                forbidden zone.
              </p>
              <p>For this project there would be two rounds of testing, with
                your best bracket counting for your grade. Students could test
                beforehand, but the TA's would manufacture the actual bracket.
              </p>

                </div>
              </div>

              <p>My initial ideas were split into a couple different 'families'.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The first set took inspiration from bridges and other trussed
                systems. These were ultimatly unsuited for the task as these
                designs placed too much stress in bending.</li>

                <li>The second set of ideas came from thinking about how a rope
                would perform the task, as I was searching for a design to place
                most, if not all of the load into axial tension rather than
                bending or shear. My final designs came from this line of thinking.</li>

                <li>The last concept was one in which compression was the main stress
                mode as compression was around 70% stronger than tension. The weight
                savings were unfortunatly canceled out with the added distance traveled
                as well as buckling.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Version I</h3>
              <p>This was the design that was used for the initial testing. It has
                a few features that made it suited well for this project.
                First, most of the stress is placed in tension, which allows
                for the main beam to be very thin. This is achieved by having
                the location in which the weight interfaces with
                the bracket 'dip down'. The beams therefore essentially
                act as two force members.
                Next, the outside edge near the attachment points is not
                perfectly circular. There are regions that are thicker due
                to the stress concentrations that were present.
              </p>
             <div class="box alt">
               <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                 <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bracket-stressv1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
               </div>
             </div>
             <p>
             In the end, although this bracket weighed only 0.94 grams, it was
              on the safer side as it was important to have a successful
              test to allow for me to really push the limits on the second test.
             </p>

             <h3>The Iterative Process</h3>
             <p>One of the major design considerations was the inherent inconsitencies
               found in the laser cutters. The TA's would cut the bracket on one of
               three cutters, each of which had a different kerf. This therefore
               required extensive testing to ensure that the bracket could function
               regardless of laser cutter.
             </p>
             <p>These incosistencies were quite frustrating for me as it was very
               difficult to get a consistent bracket with the low factor of safety
               that I was using. I performed multiple tests, and in one round of
               testing, I got a statistically insignificant event where I got 3 tests
               in a row to work but the subsequent 12 tests to result in only one success.
             </p>

             <div class="box alt">
               <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                 <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bracket iterations.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                 <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/brackets.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                 <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/statistically insignificant.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
               </div>
             </div>

             <p> One aspect that I began to explore after the first round of testing
               was the way the bracket was attached. I explored using different
               mounting holes as well as explored different geometries to interface
               with the mounting pegs. I ended up determining that the initial
               concept of circular holes was the most consistent for minimal weight
               gain.
             </p>

             <h3> Final Design </h3>
             <p>Through my multitudes of both Solidworks iterations, and physical
              testing, I was able to make significant changes to my bracket for the
              second round of testing. If you compare the stress models for both versions,
              three things become apparent, first the maximum stress of the final version is
              significantly lower. Second, the contact stresses, especially at the bottom are
              significantly lower. Finally, the difference in stress between the top and bottom
              of the main beam is signifacntly less.
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li>The first major change was how the weight was being held. Before,
                 where there was the dip as well as the complete circle holding the
                 weight, now there was section that had multiple fillets, and differing
                 thickness. Not only did this decrease the stress at and around the
                 point of contact, but it allowed for more of the stress within the beams to
                 be tension.
               </li>

               <li>With this decrease in stress within the main beams, they were able
                 to become slightly thinner than the first design. This was mainy an
                 improvement in relation to weight.
               </li>

               <li> The last major alteration between versions was the lack of localized thicker
                 portions at the upper contacts. With the changes made lower down in the design,
                 like the contact stresses int the lower contact, the upper contact stresses were
                 no longer the driving stresses and those thicker parts could be removed for
                 weight saving purposes without jepordizing the structural integrity.
               </li>
             </ul>

                 <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bracket-stressv2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
               </div>
             </div>

             <h3>Discussion </h3>
             <p>My final bracket weighed 0.72 grams. Not only was this
               nearly a 25% reduction of mass from an already light bracket, but
               my bracket was 8% lighter than the next lightest bracket. With my two
               brackets (0.94g and 0.72g), I was the best in the class for both rounds of testing.
             </p>
             <p>One of the greatest lessons I learned during this whole process
               was the difficulties of working around manufacturing constraints.
               When a part is functioning with a factor of saftey close to 1, any
               small defect could spell disaster. The large amount of testing that
               I had to conduct was due to this constraint. In an environment where
               large amounts of testing would not be possible, such as the real world,
               I would have to settle for a much higher fator of safety.
             </p>
             <p> One skill that I gained from this project was in using Solidworks
               Simulations. I previously had limited exposure to the software,
               but after the number of iteartions that I tested, I became very comfortable
               with the it and my ability to run static simulations and get the desired results.
